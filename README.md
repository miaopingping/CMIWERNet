# CMIWERNet

**CMIWERNet: Salient Object Detection via Cross-Model Interaction and Wavelet-guided Edge Refinement**

This repository is reserved for the official implementation of the proposed **CMIWERNet** framework.  

> 🔧 **Note:** The code is currently undergoing an organization process and will be made available to the research community soon. Stay tuned for updates.

## Datasets
CMIWERNet was trained on the DUTS-TR training set and evaluated on all six test datasets. Below are the links to download each dataset:
- [DUTS](http://saliencydetection.net/duts/)  
- [DUT-OMRON](http://saliencydetection.net/dut-omron/)  
- [HKU-IS](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~gbli/deep_saliency.html)  
- [PASCAL-S](https://www.yanweifu.com/cvpr2014/)  
- [SOD](http://elderlab.yorku.ca/SOD/)
